## 👋 Hey there, I’m Levon

🎯 Tactical Technologist | 🧠 Data-Driven Builder | 🛠️ Smart Home Hacker

I'm a U.S. Air Force veteran turned Computer Science student with a minor in Data Science, passionate about solving real-world problems with code. I specialize in Python, Java, SQL, and automation, and I love building tools that make life smarter, faster, and more fun—whether it’s a Flask app for fantasy football, a quantified self dashboard, or a machine learning pipeline for intelligence analysis.

🧰 Tools I live in: PyCharm • CLion • PostgreSQL • Streamlit • Flask • Docker • ArcGIS • Home Assistant  
🎙️ Fun fact: I co-host a podcast as a fantasy football beat reporter alter ego.

🚀 Let’s build something useful, automated, or hilarious.
